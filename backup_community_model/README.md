# Community Streaming Model Backup

This directory contains backups of the original multi-creator community streaming model files that were modified when transitioning to a single-creator educational platform model.

## Files Included

- `content-moderation.js` - Original multi-user content moderation system
- `ai-companion.js` - Original AI companion with community-focused features
- `creator-dashboard.html` - Original dashboard with multi-creator collaboration features
- `homepage.html` - Original homepage with community streaming focus

## How to Restore

If you want to revert to the community streaming model:

1. Copy these files back to their original locations:

   - `content-moderation.js` → `assets/js/content-moderation.js`
   - `ai-companion.js` → `assets/js/ai-companion.js`
   - `creator-dashboard.html` → root directory
   - `homepage.html` → `_includes/homepage.html`

2. You may need to delete the new `content-safety.js` file or modify your HTML files to reference `content-moderation.js` instead of `content-safety.js`.

1. **Multi-Creator Support** - Platform designed for multiple content creators to collaborate
