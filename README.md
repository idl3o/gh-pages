# Project Web Application

This repository hosts the source code for our main web application, integrating various backend services and blockchain components.

## Application Architecture

The web application integrates several key components:

- **Frontend:** (Details to be added - e.g., React, Vue, etc., using the TypeScript SDK)
- **TypeScript SDK:** Client library for interacting with backend services and blockchain components.
- **Smart Contracts:** Ethereum and potentially other blockchain contract implementations.
- **RED X Backend:** WASM-based backend processing engine for specific tasks.
- **Serverless Functions:** API endpoints and backend logic hosted on serverless platforms (e.g., Netlify, Azure Functions).

## Documentation

Project documentation, including API references, architecture details, and setup guides, can be found in the `/docs` directory or linked within the application where relevant.

## Local Development

To run this web application locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (specify version), potentially Docker, and any other required tools installed.
2.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Example using npm (adjust if using yarn or other package managers)
    npm install
    # Potentially install dependencies for sub-projects (e.g., cd ts && npm install)
    ```
4.  **Environment Setup:** Configure necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, connection strings) - refer to `.env.example` or documentation.
5.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Example using npm (adjust based on actual start script)
    npm run dev
    ```
6.  Access the application, typically at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address (check terminal output).

*(Note: These instructions are placeholders and should be updated based on the specific frontend framework and build tools chosen.)*
