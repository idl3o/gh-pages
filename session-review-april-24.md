# StreamChain Dashboard Session Review - April 24, 2025

## Today's Accomplishments

1. **Explored the Creator Dashboard Interface**
   - Reviewed the main dashboard layout and components
   - Analyzed content management and analytics sections
   - Examined the wallet integration features

2. **Upload Modal Functionality Assessment**
   - Reviewed the single-file upload workflow (4-step process)
   - Analyzed file selection, details, monetization, and publishing steps
   - Identified the NFT creation and monetization options

3. **Batch Upload Feature Review**
   - Examined the batch upload implementation
   - Analyzed the CSV import functionality
   - Reviewed the folder upload structure capability

4. **Code Structure Overview**
   - Explored component structure for upload functionalities
   - Reviewed JavaScript logic for file handling
   - Analyzed IPFS integration for decentralized storage

## Issues Identified

1. **Batch Upload Performance**
   - Current implementation may struggle with large batches (>50 files)
   - Progress tracking shows inconsistencies when network is unstable
   - Need better error handling for failed uploads within a batch

2. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Batch upload interface needs optimization for mobile devices
   - CSV template section overlaps on smaller screens
   - File preview thumbnails need better scaling on mobile

3. **NFT Integration**
   - Lazy minting process needs better user feedback
   - Royalty percentage calculations should be clearer
   - Edition size limits should be explained better

## Action Items for Tomorrow

1. **Batch Upload Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement resume functionality for interrupted batch uploads
   - [ ] Add file type filtering options
   - [ ] Create better visual feedback during IPFS upload process
   - [ ] Add drag-and-drop reordering of batch items

2. **Metadata Enhancement**
   - [ ] Add AI-assisted metadata generation for batch uploads
   - [ ] Implement batch tagging functionality
   - [ ] Create automatic category suggestion based on content

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - [ ] Document the batch upload process for user guide
   - [ ] Create visual walkthrough of the batch upload workflow
   - [ ] Develop admin documentation for backend management of batch uploads

4. **Performance Testing**
   - [ ] Test batch upload with various file sizes and types
   - [ ] Measure IPFS upload speeds and optimize where possible
   - [ ] Profile JavaScript performance during batch operations

## Resources Needed

1. **Development**
   - Additional IPFS storage allocation for testing large uploads
   - Access to simulation environment for network throttling tests
   - Updated Web3 libraries for improved blockchain transaction handling

2. **Design**
   - Updated mockups for mobile-optimized batch upload interface
   - Revised progress indicator designs
   - New iconography for file type indicators

## Notes
