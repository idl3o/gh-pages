# PRX Blockchain Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
PRX Blockchain is a custom blockchain implementation for Project RED X, designed to provide token-based ownership, content management, and governance functionality. This implementation extends the SimpleTokenChain with features specifically tailored to the PRX ecosystem.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)
- [x] Extend SimpleTokenChain to create PRXTokenChain contract
- [x] Add PRX-specific metadata to tokens (content URI, content type, privacy settings)
- [x] Implement governance foundation with proposals and voting
- [x] Create frontend interface for PRX Blockchain GUI
- [x] Develop deployment scripts for contract and frontend

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality
- [ ] Add token minting quotas and rate limiting
- [ ] Implement tiered access controls for private content
- [ ] Create content verification mechanism
- [ ] Add token delegation for voting power
- [ ] Implement proposal execution pipeline for governance actions
- [ ] Add transaction fee model and revenue distribution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Create cross-chain bridge for token interoperability
- [ ] Implement Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced gas costs
- [ ] Add zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving transactions
- [ ] Implement decentralized storage integration for content
- [ ] Create developer API for application integration
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard for ecosystem metrics

### Phase 4: Security & Compliance
- [ ] Perform comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Implement emergency pause functionality
- [ ] Add compliance reporting features
- [ ] Create permissioned admin controls
- [ ] Implement multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- [ ] Add automated monitoring and alert system

### Phase 5: Ecosystem Growth
- [ ] Create developer documentation and SDKs
- [ ] Implement incentive program for ecosystem participation
- [ ] Add marketplace functionality for token trading
- [ ] Create integration plugins for popular CMS platforms
- [ ] Launch community grants program
- [ ] Implement reputation system

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure
- **PRXTokenChain**: Core contract extending SimpleTokenChain
  - Token creation and management
  - Block generation and chain validation
  - Governance functionality with proposal and voting system
  - Content metadata and linking

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Blockchain statistics and visualization
- **Minting Interface**: Create new tokens with associated content
- **Explorer**: Browse blocks and tokens in the chain
- **Governance**: Create and vote on proposals
- **My Assets**: Manage owned tokens and content links

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Ethereum Network**: Base layer for contract deployment
- **IPFS/Content Storage**: Decentralized storage for token-associated content
- **MetaMask Integration**: Wallet connectivity and transaction signing
- **GitHub Pages Hosting**: Deployment platform for frontend interface

## Implementation Notes

### Smart Contract Considerations
- Gas optimization for token minting and content linking
- Security measures for governance actions
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Event emission for frontend synchronization

### Frontend Development
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Real-time updates for blockchain changes
- MetaMask integration for seamless transaction handling
- Content preview for various media types

### Deployment Strategy
- Contract deployment to test networks before mainnet
- Frontend deployment to GitHub Pages
- Documentation publication for users and developers
- Community engagement for feature testing and feedback

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining elements of Phase 1
2. Begin implementation of Phase 2 features with focus on token minting quotas and content verification
3. Conduct initial testing with small user group
4. Gather feedback and adjust implementation plan accordingly
