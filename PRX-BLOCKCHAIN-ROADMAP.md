# Project Web Application - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the main Project Web Application. The application will serve as the primary user interface, integrating the TypeScript SDK, Smart Contracts, RED X Backend services, and Serverless Functions to provide a comprehensive user experience.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Set up VS Code Workspace for multi-root development (e.g., `/`, `/ts`, `/contracts`).
- [ ] Choose and initialize frontend framework (e.g., React/Vite, Next.js, Vue).
- [ ] Establish frontend project structure (components, pages/views, styles, utils, services).
- [ ] Integrate base styling (`assets/css/main.css`) and adapt for the chosen framework.
- [ ] Implement basic routing (e.g., using React Router, Vue Router).
- [ ] Create core layout components (Header, Sidebar/Navigation, Main Content Area, Footer).
- [ ] Set up linting (ESLint), formatting (Prettier - if desired), and testing tools (e.g., Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library) for the frontend.
- [ ] Configure build tools (e.g., Vite, Webpack) and development server.

### Phase 2: SDK Integration & Core UI
- [ ] Integrate the TypeScript SDK (`/ts`) into the frontend application as a dependency or module.
- [ ] Develop UI components for connecting wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- [ ] Build components to display data fetched via the SDK (e.g., token balances, contract states, user profile info).
- [ ] Implement basic user interactions based on SDK capabilities (e.g., read-only contract interactions).
- [ ] Refine UI/UX according to the chosen framework's best practices and the established design.
- [ ] Add state management solution if needed (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Pinia, Context API).

### Phase 3: Backend & Serverless Integration
- [ ] Develop necessary serverless functions (`/netlify/functions` or other providers like Azure Functions) for backend logic not covered by the SDK/contracts directly (e.g., user-specific data aggregation, off-chain processing).
- [ ] Define API contracts between frontend and serverless functions.
- [ ] Connect the frontend to these serverless API endpoints.
- [ ] Implement user authentication/authorization if required (e.g., JWT, session-based, integration with external providers).
- [ ] Integrate with RED X backend services if needed, likely via dedicated serverless functions acting as proxies or orchestrators.

### Phase 4: Feature Implementation
- [ ] Build UI modules for specific features (referencing original roadmap items where applicable):
    - [ ] Token Minting Interface
    - [ ] Content Management/Linking UI
    - [ ] Governance Proposal Creation & Voting UI
    - [ ] User Asset Management Dashboard
    - [ ] Blockchain Explorer Interface (if needed within the app)
    - [ ] Tiered Access Control UI (if applicable)
- [ ] Ensure features interact correctly and securely with the SDK, contracts, and serverless functions.
- [ ] Implement transaction signing flows using the connected wallet.
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for new features.

### Phase 5: Testing, Optimization & Deployment Prep
- [ ] Conduct thorough end-to-end testing across different browsers and devices.
- [ ] Perform security reviews of frontend, serverless functions, and interactions with contracts.
- [ ] Implement necessary security measures (input validation, rate limiting, CSRF/XSS protection).
- [ ] Optimize frontend performance (code splitting, lazy loading, bundle size analysis, image optimization).
- [ ] Optimize serverless function performance and costs (cold starts, memory usage).
- [ ] Prepare deployment configurations (environment variables for different stages - dev, staging, prod).
- [ ] Finalize build settings for production.

### Phase 6: Deployment & Operations
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Netlify Build, Azure DevOps) for automated building, testing, and deployment.
- [ ] Choose and configure hosting platform for the frontend (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Azure Static Web Apps).
- [ ] Deploy serverless functions to their respective platforms.
- [ ] Configure custom domains and DNS settings.
- [ ] Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting for the deployed application (frontend and backend).
- [ ] Establish a process for updates and maintenance.

## Technical Stack (Initial - Subject to Refinement)

- **Frontend:** TBD (e.g., React with Vite, Next.js, Vue)
- **Styling:** CSS (`assets/css/main.css`), potentially CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS
- **SDK:** TypeScript SDK (`/ts`)
- **Blockchain:** Smart Contracts (`/contracts`) on Ethereum (or specified network)
- **Backend Logic:** Serverless Functions (Netlify Functions, Azure Functions, etc.)
- **WASM Backend:** RED X (`/red_x`)
- **Wallet Integration:** Ethers.js/Viem, Web3Modal/ConnectKit
- **Hosting:** TBD (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Azure)
- **CI/CD:** TBD (e.g., GitHub Actions)

## Development Workflow

- **Branching:** Gitflow or GitHub Flow (TBD)
- **Code Reviews:** Required for all pull requests.
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are expected.
- **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub Issues.
