# Web3 Crypto Streaming Service: Key Definitions

This document provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service platform.

## Core Concepts

### Web3
A new iteration of the internet built on decentralized protocols, featuring peer-to-peer interactions without centralized intermediaries. Web3 incorporates blockchain technology, token-based economics, and decentralized governance.

### Blockchain
A distributed, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, creating a chain that ensures the integrity and chronological order of transactions.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when predetermined conditions are met, without requiring intermediaries.

## Platform Components

### STREAM Token
The native utility token of the Web3 Crypto Streaming platform that facilitates platform governance, subscription payments, creator incentives, and reduced transaction fees.

### Content Addressing
The method by which content is identified and accessed through its cryptographic hash rather than a specific location. This enables content integrity verification and censorship resistance.

### Decentralized CDN
A content delivery network distributed across multiple nodes without central control, ensuring resilience against censorship and improved content availability.

### P2P Streaming
Peer-to-peer streaming technology that enables direct content delivery between users, reducing bandwidth costs and improving streaming resilience.

## Technical Architecture

### Protocol Layer
The foundational layer that includes smart contracts, token economics, and authentication systems. It handles the rules governing interactions on the platform.

### Infrastructure Layer
The middle layer that manages content storage (IPFS), delivery networks, and encoding processes for optimal streaming quality.

### User Layer
The top layer that includes user-facing applications and interfaces (web, mobile) that provide access to the platform's functionality.

### Blockchain Layer
The base layer that provides decentralized consensus, transaction processing, and immutable record-keeping through Ethereum, Polygon, and oracle services.

## Economic Model

### Creator-First Economics
A revenue model where content creators receive 90%+ of generated revenue, significantly higher than traditional platforms that typically offer 30-50%.

### Token Distribution
The allocation of STREAM tokens across different stakeholders including public sale (30%), platform development (25%), creator incentives (20%), team and advisors (15%), and community/ecosystem growth (10%).

### Staking
The process of locking up tokens to support network operations and earn rewards. On our platform, staking enables participation in governance and access to premium features.

### DAO Governance
Decentralized Autonomous Organization governance allows token holders to vote on platform decisions, protocol upgrades, and fund allocations.

## User Roles

### Creator
Individuals or entities who produce and publish content on the platform. Creators can monetize their content through subscriptions, one-time payments, or tips.

### Viewer
Users who consume content on the platform and may support creators through subscriptions, tips, or engagement.

### Node Operator
Entities that maintain infrastructure components of the network, such as content delivery nodes or encoding services, in exchange for token rewards.

### Developer
Technical contributors who build upon the platform's APIs and SDKs to create additional functionality or integrations.
