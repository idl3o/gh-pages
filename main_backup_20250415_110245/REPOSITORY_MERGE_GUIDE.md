# Repository Merge Guide

This document provides instructions for merging the idl3o/gh-pages repository with our current Web3 Crypto Streaming Service repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Git installed on your local machine
2. Command line terminal or Git bash
3. Write access to both repositories (or a fork of idl3o/gh-pages if you don't have direct access)

## Step 1: Clone Both Repositories

If you haven't already cloned the repositories locally, do so:

```bash
# Clone your repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gh-pages.git

# Clone the idl3o repository to a different directory
git clone https://github.com/idl3o/gh-pages.git idl3o-gh-pages
```

## Step 2: Add idl3o's Repository as a Remote

Navigate to your repository directory and add idl3o's repository as a remote:

```bash
cd gh-pages
git remote add idl3o https://github.com/idl3o/gh-pages.git
git fetch idl3o
```

## Step 3: Review Content Before Merging

Before merging, you should review what's in the idl3o repository to determine which files you want to keep and which might conflict:

```bash
# Review the file structure
git ls-tree -r --name-only idl3o/main

# Compare specific files or directories
git diff HEAD..idl3o/main -- path/to/file/or/directory
```

## Step 4: Choose a Merge Strategy

### Option A: Complete Merge

If you want to merge all of idl3o's content with your repository:

```bash
# Create a new branch for the merge
git checkout -b merge-idl3o

# Merge the main branch from idl3o (or master if that's their default)
git merge idl3o/main

# Resolve any conflicts that occur
# Edit conflicted files, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge idl3o/gh-pages repository"
```

### Option B: Cherry-Pick Specific Commits

If you only want specific changes from idl3o's repository:

```bash
# Create a branch for cherry-picking
git checkout -b cherry-pick-idl3o

# Find commits you want to include
git log idl3o/main

# Cherry-pick each commit you want
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Resolve conflicts if necessary
```

### Option C: Copy Specific Files

If you only want certain files:

```bash
# Create a branch for file copies
git checkout -b copy-idl3o-files

# Copy files from the other repository
cp -r ../idl3o-gh-pages/path/to/file ./destination/

# Add and commit the copied files
git add .
git commit -m "Add selected files from idl3o/gh-pages"
```

## Step 5: Review the Combined Result

After merging, carefully review the combined repository to ensure everything looks correct:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Review the file structure
ls -la

# Review recent commits
git log --oneline -n 10
```

## Step 6: Push Changes

Once you're satisfied with the merge:

```bash
# Push your changes to your repository
git push origin merge-idl3o  # or whichever branch you created
```

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request (Optional)

If you're working with a team, create a pull request to have others review the merged content before it's merged to your main branch.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Dealing with Large Files

If the idl3o repository contains large files tracked by Git LFS (Large File Storage):

```bash
# Install Git LFS if not already installed
git lfs install

# Fetch LFS objects
git lfs pull idl3o
```

### Handling Theme and Layout Conflicts

Pay special attention to theme files, layouts, and configuration files like `_config.yml`, as these often cause conflicts when merging Jekyll-based GitHub Pages repositories.

### Managing Dependencies

If both repositories use different versions of dependencies:

1. Compare `Gemfile` or `package.json` files
2. Update to use the newer versions where appropriate
3. Test the site locally before pushing

## Testing the Combined Site

Before finalizing the merge:

1. Build and run the site locally
2. Test all functionality
3. Verify that all links work
4. Check for visual inconsistencies

```bash
# For Jekyll sites
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

# For npm-based sites
npm install
npm start
```
