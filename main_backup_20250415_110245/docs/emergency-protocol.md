# GitHub SOS - Protocol for On-chain Emergency Blockchain Control

This document outlines the step-by-step emergency procedures for responding to critical blockchain incidents affecting the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service platform.

## Emergency Classification

| Level | Name | Description | Response Time | Escalation Path |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Alert** | Minor issue, non-critical | 24 hours | Engineering Team |
| 2 | **Warning** | Service degradation | 4 hours | Engineering + On-call |
| 3 | **Critical** | Service disruption | 1 hour | Incident Command + Leadership |
| 4 | **Emergency** | Security breach | Immediate | Full response team + Legal |
| 5 | **Catastrophic** | Smart contract compromise | Immediate | All hands + External partners |

## Emergency Response Team

### Incident Commander
- Coordinates overall response
- Makes critical decisions
- Communicates with leadership

### Technical Lead
- Directs technical response
- Evaluates solution options
- Coordinates with blockchain specialists

### Communications Officer
- Updates community channels
- Prepares user notifications
- Coordinates with social media team

### Security Officer
- Evaluates security implications
- Secures compromised systems
- Coordinates with external security if needed

## On-Chain Emergency Governance Procedures

### Emergency Governance Council

The platform maintains a 5-member Emergency Governance Council with the following responsibilities:
- Evaluate potential security threats
- Initiate emergency governance actions
- Oversee recovery operations

Council members are elected every 6 months through quadratic voting by STREAM token holders.

## On-Chain Emergency Procedures

### Smart Contract Pause (Level 4-5)
```solidity
// Emergency pause function
function emergencyPause() external onlyEmergencyAdmin {
    _pause();
    emit EmergencyPauseActivated(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}
```

1. Access multi-signature wallet through hardware keys (3-of-5 required)
2. Initiate emergency pause transaction
3. Verify transaction success on blockchain explorer
4. Communicate pause to all stakeholders
5. Initiate emergency governance process for remediation

### Transaction Filtering (Level 3-4)
1. Deploy emergency filter rules to API endpoints
2. Enable heightened gas estimation thresholds
3. Implement queue prioritization for critical functions
4. Monitor filter effectiveness in real-time

### Node Recovery (Level 2-3)
1. Identify affected nodes and consensus issues
2. Initiate failover to backup infrastructure
3. Re-sync affected nodes from verified snapshots
4. Validate chain integrity before returning to service

### Data Integrity Verification (All Levels)
1. Compare on-chain state with off-chain databases
2. Run integrity verification across state checkpoints
3. Generate discrepancy report for resolution
4. Apply reconciliation transactions if needed

## Communication Templates

### User Notification - Level 3+
