# Web3 Crypto Streaming Service: Project Analysis

## Key Use Cases

### Content Creator Platform
- **Direct monetization** with 90% revenue share
- **Per-second content payment streams** for granular compensation
- **Content ownership verification** through blockchain
- **Decentralized content distribution** for censorship resistance
- **Custom subscription and pay-per-view models** for flexible monetization

### Viewer Experience
- **Decentralized content access** without platform restrictions
- **Token-based payment system** for frictionless transactions
- **Premium feature access** through STREAM tokens
- **Cross-platform content consumption** with consistent experience

## Technical Infrastructure

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
// Core Smart Contracts Identified
// StreamAccessContract    // Content access and payments
// ProofOfExistence       // Content authenticity
// StreamingToken         // Platform economics
// StreamPayment         // Micropayments
```

### Token Utility (STREAM)
- Content purchase and subscription payments
- Governance participation
- Staking rewards
- Platform feature access

## Implementation Recommendations

### Security Enhancement
```javascript
const securityMeasures = {
  contentProtection: {
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM',
    keyManagement: 'decentralized',
    accessControl: 'smart-contract-based'
  },
  userAuthentication: {
    method: 'wallet-based',
    2FA: true,
    sessionManagement: 'token-based'
  }
};
```

### Scalability Measures
