# Smart Contracts in Action: Real-World Applications

This document demonstrates how our smart contracts directly enable real-world applications, bridging the gap between blockchain technology and practical use cases for content creators and viewers.

## Bringing Smart Contracts to Life

While smart contract code may appear technical, the applications they enable are transforming how digital content is distributed, monetized, and consumed.

## Case Study 1: Independent Filmmaker

**Creator:** Maya, an independent documentary filmmaker

**Scenario:** Maya has produced a documentary exposing environmental issues but struggles with traditional distribution platforms taking large cuts and controlling her content's availability.

### How Our Smart Contracts Help

**Step 1: Content Registration**

Maya uploads her documentary to our platform, which triggers the `StreamAccessContract`:

```solidity
// StreamAccessContract.sol
function registerContent(
    bytes32 contentId,
    uint256 price,
    bool isPremium,
    uint256 royaltyPercent,
    string memory contentHash
)
```

**Real-world impact:** 
- Her content's authenticity is verified and timestamped using `ProofOfExistence`
- She maintains full intellectual property rights
- She sets her own price (0.001 ETH, approximately $3)
- She retains 90% of all revenue

**Step 2: Content Monetization**

Maya offers multiple access models:
- Pay-per-view for casual viewers
- Subscription for fans who want early access to future releases

```solidity
// StreamingToken.sol
function startStream(string memory contentId)
```

**Step 3: Payment Streaming**

As viewers watch her content, the payment flows continuously:

```solidity
// StreamPayment.sol
function createStream(address recipient, uint256 ratePerSecond)
```

**Real-world impact:**
- Maya receives payments in real-time rather than monthly payouts
- No minimum threshold for withdrawals
- No intermediaries taking additional fees
- Global audience, unrestricted by geographic payment limitations

## Case Study 2: Educational Platform

**Creator:** Professor Chen, computer science educator

**Scenario:** Professor Chen wants to create a programming course with tiered access models and collaborative revenue sharing with teaching assistants.

### Smart Contract Integration

**Step 1: Collaborative Content Structure**

Using custom payment splits:

```solidity
// PaymentSplitter.sol (simplified)
function setCustomSplit(
    address _creator, 
    uint256 _creatorShare, 
    address[] memory _additionalRecipients, 
    uint256[] memory _additionalShares
)
```

**Real-world impact:**
- Professor Chen automatically shares 15% with teaching assistants
- Payment distribution happens immediately upon purchase
- Transparent tracking of all revenue

**Step 2: Tiered Access Models**

Professor Chen creates different subscription plans:

```solidity
// SubscriptionManager.sol
function createPlan(string memory _name, uint256 _price, uint256 _duration)
```

**Plans offered:**
1. Basic access: Course videos only
2. Premium access: Videos + code repositories
3. Mentorship access: Everything + weekly office hours

**Step 3: Proof of Learning**

Students receive verifiable certificates of completion:

```solidity
// ProofOfExistence.sol
function registerProof(
    bytes32 contentHash, 
    bytes32 certificateSignature,
    uint256 completionScore
)
```

## Case Study 3: Music Artist Collective

**Creators:** Indie music collective with 5 artists

**Scenario:** The collective wants to release albums while transparently sharing revenue based on contribution to each track.

### Smart Contract Flow

**Step 1: Collective Ownership Registration**

The group registers their album using multi-signature capability:

```solidity
// CreatorProfiles.sol (simplified)
function registerCollective(
    address[] memory members,
    string memory collectiveName
)
```

**Step 2: Proportional Revenue Distribution**

Each track has customized revenue splits based on contribution:

```solidity
// Example configuration for Track 1
Track: "Midnight Symphony"
- Artist A (vocals): 40%
- Artist B (composition): 35%
- Artist C (production): 25%
```

**Real-world impact:**
- Transparent attribution of work
- Automatic payment distribution
- Full history of contribution and payments

**Step 3: Superfan Engagement**

The collective offers premium listening experiences for their superfans:

```solidity
// Example subscription option
Premium Membership:
- Early access to new releases
- High-fidelity audio streams
- Exclusive behind-the-scenes content
- Direct input on future creative directions
```
