# Code Review Approach & Project Roadmap

This document outlines best practices for systematically reviewing the codebase, along with a phased roadmap for the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service.

## 1. Code Review Checklist

### Security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Re-entrancy and overflow checks in Solidity

### Performance
- [ ] Efficient queries and caching
- [ ] Scalable contract design
- [ ] Minimized gas usage

### Quality
- [ ] Consistent coding style
- [ ] Meaningful naming conventions
- [ ] Reusable functions and components

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for critical contracts
- [ ] Integration tests for payment flows
- [ ] Edge case coverage

### Documentation
- [ ] README and setup instructions
- [ ] API or contract interface docs
- [ ] Architecture diagrams

## 2. Use Case Overview

1. Decentralized Content Streaming  
   - Creators register content with `StreamAccessContract`  
   - Viewers pay using `StreamingToken` or ETH, optionally per-second with `StreamPayment`.

2. Content Authenticity  
   - `ProofOfExistence` ensures unique, verifiable content hashes  
   - Integrated with multiple content registration scenarios.

3. Premium Access & Subscriptions  
   - Tiered subscriptions managed by custom contracts  
   - Automated royalty splits for multi-creator collaborations.

## 3. Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Q2-Q4 2025): Foundation
- Launch core contracts (StreamAccess, ProofOfExistence, StreamPayment)
- Onboard first beta creators with testnet
- Conduct initial security audit

### Phase 2 (Q1-Q3 2026): Expansion
- Add creator analytics dashboards
- Introduce multi-chain support
- Scale to broader content categories (music, podcasts)

### Phase 3 (Q4 2026-Q4 2027): Maturity
- Implement DAO-based governance for platform decisions
- Release advanced NFT-based licensing
- Expand to enterprise-level streaming partnerships

## 4. Example Automated Checks

- ESLint / Prettier for linting and formatting
- Hardhat + Chai for Solidity testing
- npm audit or Snyk for dependency security
- Slither for smart contract static analysis
