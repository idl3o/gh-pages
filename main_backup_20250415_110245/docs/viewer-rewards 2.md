# Viewer Rewards System

This document details the cash reward mechanisms available to viewers on the Web3 Crypto Streaming Service platform, explaining how to earn rewards, redemption options, and engagement incentives.

## Rewards Overview

Our platform uniquely rewards viewers for their engagement and attention, creating a two-sided economy where both creators and viewers can earn from quality content interactions. This rewards system is designed to incentivize active participation, high-quality feedback, and sustained engagement.

## Earning Methods

Viewers can earn rewards through multiple avenues:

### 1. Watch-to-Earn

Earn STREAM tokens simply by watching content:

- **Basic Rewards**: Earn 0.1 STREAM per hour of verified content viewing
- **Premium Multipliers**: Earn up to 3x rewards on premium subscription content
- **Focus Bonuses**: Earn additional rewards for uninterrupted viewing sessions

### 2. Engagement Activities

Additional rewards for meaningful interactions:

- **Quality Comments**: Earn rewards for comments rated helpful by creators/community
- **Content Discovery**: Earn when you share content that reaches new viewers
- **Feedback Rewards**: Earn for providing valuable feedback that creators implement

### 3. Daily Cash Rewards

Special daily rewards distributed to active viewers:

- **Daily Check-in**: Small reward for logging in each day consecutively
- **Viewing Streaks**: Increasing rewards for maintaining daily viewing streaks
- **Random Prize Drops**: Surprise cash rewards randomly distributed to active viewers

## Reward Schedule

| Activity | Reward Amount | Distribution Schedule | Requirements |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Watch Time | 0.1 STREAM/hour | Real-time accrual | Verified viewing (anti-bot measures) |
| Daily Check-in | 1 STREAM | Instant upon login | Once per 24 hours |
| Comment Rewards | 1-5 STREAM | Weekly distribution | Must receive positive ratings |
| Streak Bonus | Day 7: 10 STREAM<br>Day 30: 50 STREAM | Upon streak milestone | Continuous daily activity |
| Cash Prize Drop | $1-$100 USD | Random distribution | Must be actively watching during drop |

## Cash Rewards System

Our unique feature is the direct cash reward system that converts earned tokens to fiat currency:

### How It Works

1. **Earning Phase**: Accumulate STREAM tokens through platform activities
2. **Cash Out Options**:
   - Direct bank transfer (minimum 100 STREAM)
   - Cryptocurrency withdrawal
   - Platform credit for subscription purchases

### Weekly Cash Prize Pool

Every week, a portion of platform revenue is allocated to the viewer cash prize pool:

```
Weekly Prize Pool = 5% of Platform Revenue + Base Pool ($10,000)
```

Active viewers receive shares of this pool based on their engagement metrics:

```javascript
// Simplified reward calculation
function calculateUserRewardShare(userData, totalPlatformActivity) {
  const userWatchTimeWeight = userData.watchTimeMinutes * 0.5;
  const userEngagementWeight = userData.engagementScore * 0.3;
  const userStreakWeight = userData.currentStreak * 0.2;
  
  const userTotalWeight = userWatchTimeWeight + userEngagementWeight + userStreakWeight;
  const userSharePercentage = userTotalWeight / totalPlatformActivity;
  
  return weeklyPrizePool * userSharePercentage;
}
```

## Reward Tiers and Verification

To maintain economic balance and prevent abuse, the system implements tiered rewards:

### Viewer Tiers

| Tier | Requirements | Benefits |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Bronze | New or casual viewer | Base rewards |
| Silver | 10+ hours watched | 1.2x reward multiplier |
| Gold | 50+ hours watched & 20+ quality comments | 1.5x reward multiplier + weekly bonus |
| Platinum | 100+ hours watched & 30-day streak | 2x reward multiplier + exclusive cash drops |

### Verification System

To ensure reward authenticity:

- **Attention Verification**: Periodic interactive prompts ensure active viewing
- **Anti-Bot Measures**: Machine learning detection for automated viewing
- **Engagement Quality**: Natural language processing evaluates genuine comments
- **Device Limits**: Reasonable limits on simultaneous viewing sessions

## Implementing Viewer Rewards

Developers can implement the rewards system using our SDK:

```javascript
// Example implementation
import { viewerRewardsService } from '../services/ViewerRewardsService';

async function trackViewingSession(contentId, playerInstance) {
  // Initialize reward tracking
  const sessionId = await viewerRewardsService.startSession(contentId);
  
  // Set up attention verification events
  playerInstance.addEventListener('timeupdate', (event) => {
    // Send periodic heartbeats to verify viewing
    if (event.currentTime % 60 < 1) { // Approximately every minute
      viewerRewardsService.trackProgress(sessionId, event.currentTime);
    }
  });
  
  // Handle attention verification prompts
  viewerRewardsService.onVerificationRequired((verificationData) => {
    // Show the verification prompt to the user
    showVerificationPrompt(verificationData.question, (userAnswer) => {
      viewerRewardsService.submitVerification(sessionId, userAnswer);
    });
  });
  
  // Clean up when viewing ends
  playerInstance.addEventListener('ended', () => {
    viewerRewardsService.completeSession(sessionId);
    displayEarnedRewards();
  });
}

function displayEarnedRewards() {
  viewerRewardsService.getSessionRewards().then((rewards) => {
    showRewardNotification(`You earned ${rewards.tokens} STREAM tokens and entered into cash draws worth $${rewards.cashEntryValue}!`);
  });
}
```

## Cash Withdrawal Process

Viewers can withdraw earned cash rewards through the following process:

1. Accumulate minimum withdrawal amount (varies by method)
2. Complete identity verification (KYC for cash withdrawals)
3. Select preferred withdrawal method
4. Receive funds within 1-3 business days

## Tokenomics Impact

The viewer rewards system creates a sustainable economy by:

- Incentivizing high-quality content via viewer data signals
- Creating token velocity and utility
- Building a loyalty loop between creators and viewers
- Distributing platform value to all participants
