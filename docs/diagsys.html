<title>BubbleHeal Protocol\n\nBubbleHeal is our self-healing network protocol that automatically detects and repairs damaged connections in the blockchain network, ensuring transaction integrity.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Continuous Monitoring: Constantly checks network health and connection status\n2. Anomaly Detection: Uses AI to identify potential connection failures before they occur\n3. Automatic Repair: Implements self-healing procedures to restore connections\n4. Redundancy Management: Creates temporary pathways while repairs are in progress\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- High-frequency trading platforms requiring uninterrupted connectivity\n- Distributed ledger systems with critical uptime requirements\n- IoT networks with inconsistent connection quality\n\n## Technical Specifications\n\nSee our BubbleHeal Technical Specifications for implementation details. | Project Documentation Hub</title>
