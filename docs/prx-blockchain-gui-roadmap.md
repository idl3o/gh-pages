# PRX Blockchain GUI Roadmap

*Last updated: April 28, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for implementing the PRX blockchain GUI based on the SimpleTokenChain foundation. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the PRX blockchain with minimal effort, where each token minting adds a new block to the chain.

## Pre-Implementation Phase

### 1. Requirements Gathering and Specification
- [ ] Define PRX-specific functionalities needed in the blockchain GUI
- [ ] Document user interaction flows and use cases
- [ ] Identify integration points with existing PRX systems

### 2. Technical Assessment
- [ ] Review SimpleTokenChain implementation against PRX requirements
- [ ] Evaluate compatibility with PRX developer tools and server
- [ ] Check current OpenZeppelin libraries against security needs
- [ ] Assess frontend framework needs for the PRX user experience

### 3. Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure development environments for all team members
- [ ] Set up testing frameworks for blockchain development
- [ ] Create staging and production deployment pipelines
- [ ] Establish version control processes and branching strategy

### 4. Design Phase
- [ ] Create wireframes/mockups of the PRX blockchain GUI
- [ ] Design architecture for integration with other PRX components
- [ ] Plan data flow between blockchain and other PRX systems
- [ ] Develop a style guide aligned with PRX branding

### 5. Security Planning
- [ ] Perform security review of SimpleTokenChain contract
- [ ] Plan for external audit of PRX-specific contract modifications
- [ ] Define security protocols for user interactions and permissions
- [ ] Consider privacy implications for blockchain data visibility

### 6. Governance Structure
- [ ] Define token governance model specific to PRX
- [ ] Design upgrade path for smart contracts
- [ ] Establish administrative controls and emergency response procedures
- [ ] Document decision-making process for protocol changes

### 7. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Create comprehensive test plan (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [ ] Set up automated testing environments for CI/CD
- [ ] Design user acceptance testing protocols
- [ ] Plan performance testing for blockchain operations

### 8. Documentation Planning
- [ ] Define documentation requirements for developers and users
- [ ] Plan API documentation for PRX integration
- [ ] Create user guides for the blockchain GUI
- [ ] Document technical architecture for maintenance

### 9. Resource Allocation
- [ ] Identify team members and roles for implementation
- [ ] Allocate budget for development, testing, and deployment
- [ ] Establish timeline and milestones for the project
- [ ] Identify third-party dependencies or services needed

### 10. Risk Assessment
- [ ] Identify technical risks and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Assess regulatory compliance requirements
- [ ] Plan for graceful fallbacks in case of integration failures
- [ ] Define SLAs for blockchain performance and availability

## Implementation Phase

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Extend SimpleTokenChain contract with PRX-specific features
- [ ] Implement token governance mechanisms
- [ ] Develop initial PRX-branded UI components
- [ ] Create integration layer with PRX server

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement blockchain explorer for PRX tokens and blocks
- [ ] Develop token minting and management interface
- [ ] Create transaction history and analytics dashboard
- [ ] Implement wallet integration and connection handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add content metadata linking for PRX assets
- [ ] Implement token-gated access controls
- [ ] Develop PRX governance interface
- [ ] Create integration with WebAssembly Graphics Engine

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing across all components
- [ ] Optimize smart contract gas usage
- [ ] Perform security audits
- [ ] Stress test the system with simulated load

## Deployment Strategy

### Testnet Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to Ethereum testnet (Sepolia)
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing
- [ ] Fix issues identified during testing
- [ ] Finalize deployment configuration

### Mainnet Deployment
- [ ] Perform final security review
- [ ] Deploy smart contracts to mainnet
- [ ] Launch PRX blockchain GUI publicly
- [ ] Monitor system performance and user feedback

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Collect usage metrics and user feedback
- [ ] Plan for iterative improvements
- [ ] Develop maintenance schedule
- [ ] Prepare for future feature enhancements
