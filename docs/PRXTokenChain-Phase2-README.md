# PRX Blockchain Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

This document provides an overview of all the enhanced functionality implemented in Phase 2 of the PRX Blockchain project. It serves as a guide for developers integrating with the blockchain and users interacting with the system.

## Phase 2 Completed Features

Phase 2 introduces several critical enhancements to the PRX Blockchain:

1. **Token Minting Quotas and Rate Limiting**
2. **Tiered Access Controls for Private Content**
3. **Content Verification Mechanism**
4. **Token Delegation for Voting Power**
5. **Proposal Execution Pipeline for Governance Actions**
6. **Transaction Fee Model and Revenue Distribution**

## 1. Token Minting Quotas and Rate Limiting

To prevent spam and ensure fair distribution, we've implemented a robust quota and rate limiting system.

### Features
- Daily token minting limits per address
- Time-window based rate limiting (e.g., X tokens per hour)
- Quota exemption for trusted addresses
- Ability to enable/disable the quota system
- Governance control over quota parameters

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Check user's minting status
const [dailyRemaining, windowRemaining, timeUntilReset] = await prxContract.getMintingStatus(userAddress);

// For platform admins/governance
await prxContract.updateMintingQuota(10, 3600, 3); // 10 tokens per day, max 3 per hour
await prxContract.setQuotaExemption(trustedUser, true);
await prxContract.setQuotaEnabled(true/false);
```

## 2. Tiered Access Controls for Private Content

Content creators can now mark their content as private and monetize access.

### Features
- Token-gated content with public/private toggle
- Fee-based access for non-owners
- Automatic fee distribution between creator, platform, and community
- Permission checking system

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Mint a token with private content
await prxContract.mintWithContent(
  "Exclusive Content",
  "ipfs://QmPrivateContentHash",
  "video/mp4",
  true, // isPrivate
  contentHash
);

// Access private content (costs fee for non-owners)
const contentURI = await prxContract.accessPrivateContent(tokenId, {value: accessFee});

// Check if user can access content
const canAccess = await prxContract.canAccessContent(userAddress, tokenId);
```

## 3. Content Verification Mechanism

Enables verification of content authenticity through trusted verifiers.

### Features
- Content hash storage and verification
- Authorized verifier system with trust scores
- Configurable minimum verification requirements
- Easy verification status checking

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Verify content
await prxContract.verifyContent(tokenId);

// Check verifiers
const verifiers = await prxContract.getVerifiers(tokenId);

// For governance
await prxContract.updateRequiredVerificationsCount(3);
```

## 4. Token Delegation for Voting Power

Token holders can now delegate their voting power to other addresses.

### Features
- Delegation of voting power without transferring tokens
- Prevention of circular delegation
- Ability to undelegate at any time
- Combined voting power tracking

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Delegate voting power
await prxContract.delegate(delegateeAddress);

// Check delegation
const delegate = await prxContract.getDelegate(delegatorAddress);
const votingPower = await prxContract.getVotingPower(delegateeAddress);

// Undelegate
await prxContract.undelegate();
```

## 5. Proposal Execution Pipeline for Governance Actions

A complete on-chain governance system that allows token holders to propose, vote on, and execute changes to the protocol.

### Features
- Proposal creation with execution data
- Voting system based on token holdings
- Automatic proposal execution after successful vote
- Support for multiple governance actions

### Supported Governance Actions
- Update fee model
- Modify minting quotas
- Toggle quota enforcement
- Set quota exemptions
- Update platform wallet
- Update community treasury
- Change required verifications count
- Adjust governance threshold
- Modify minimum voting period

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Create proposal to update minting quota
const selector = prxContract.updateMintingQuota.selector;
const data = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
  name: 'updateMintingQuota',
  type: 'function',
  inputs: [
    {type: 'uint256', name: 'dailyLimit'},
    {type: 'uint256', name: 'timeWindow'},
    {type: 'uint256', name: 'windowLimit'}
  ]
}, [10, 3600, 3]);

await prxContract.createProposal(
  "Increase minting quotas",
  604800, // 1 week voting period
  data
);

// Vote on proposal
await prxContract.vote(proposalId, true);

// Execute proposal after voting period
await prxContract.executeProposal(proposalId);
```

## 6. Transaction Fee Model and Revenue Distribution

A comprehensive fee system that generates revenue for the platform, content creators, and token holders.

### Features
- Fee collection on transfers, minting, and content access
- Configurable fee percentages
- Automatic fee distribution
- Platform and community treasury management

### Fee Types
- Transfer Fee: Applied when transferring tokens (basis points)
- Mint Fee: Additional fee on token minting (basis points)
- Content Fee: Flat fee for accessing private content (ETH)

### Distribution Shares
- Platform: Operating costs and development
- Creator: Direct payment to content creators
- Stakeholder: Distributed to token holders through community treasury

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Update fee model
await prxContract.updateFeeModel(
  25,    // 0.25% transfer fee
  100,   // 1% mint fee
  0.001, // 0.001 ETH content access fee
  4000,  // 40% to platform
  4000,  // 40% to creator
  2000   // 20% to stakeholders
);

// Distribute accumulated fees
await prxContract.distributeFees();

// Update platform wallet
await prxContract.updatePlatformWallet(newWalletAddress);

// Update community treasury
await prxContract.updateCommunityTreasury(newTreasuryAddress);
```

## Smart Contract Interface

For a complete API reference, see the full contract documentation or refer to the PRXTokenChain.sol file.

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been implemented in the PRXTokenChainTest.sol contract. Run these tests to verify all functionality is working correctly before deployment.

## Next Steps: Phase 3

With Phase 2 complete, we're now ready to move on to Phase 3: Advanced Features, which will include:
- Cross-chain bridge for token interoperability
- Layer 2 scaling solution
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- Decentralized storage integration
- Developer API
- Analytics dashboard

## Security Considerations

The Phase 2 features have been implemented with security in mind, but we recommend a comprehensive security audit before mainnet deployment.
