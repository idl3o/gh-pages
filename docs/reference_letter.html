<h2 id="re-recommendation-for-sarah-chen">RE: Recommendation for Sarah Chen</h2>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>It is with great enthusiasm that I provide this reference for Sarah Chen, whom I have known since her undergraduate studies at University College London from 2005 to 2009, and have mentored throughout her professional career.</p>

<p>Sarah was an exceptional student at UCL, where she demonstrated remarkable aptitude in distributed systems and computational architecture. Her final year project on optimizing neural network inference on resource-constrained devices was ahead of its time and received departmental honors. Even then, she displayed the rare combination of theoretical understanding and practical engineering acumen that defines truly exceptional engineers.</p>

<p>In my current role as Engineering Manager for Production Inference Research in San Francisco, I have witnessed firsthand how the field has evolved to require precisely the blend of skills that Sarah has cultivated throughout her career. Her experience building efficient, reliable, and scalable systems—particularly in her recent work on high-throughput inference platforms—directly addresses the challenges faced by organizations deploying AI models in production environments.</p>

<p>What sets Sarah apart is not just her technical expertise, but her ability to translate research innovations into production-ready systems. She excels at bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementations, always maintaining focus on the end-user experience while navigating complex technical constraints.</p>

<p>Sarah’s leadership abilities are equally impressive. She builds inclusive, collaborative teams focused on impact while maintaining rigorous engineering standards. Multiple engineers whom she has mentored have gone on to leadership positions themselves, which speaks to her ability to develop talent and build strong engineering cultures.</p>

<p>I believe Sarah would be an exceptional addition to any team working on production inference systems. She brings a wealth of relevant experience, a collaborative approach to problem-solving, and the strategic thinking needed to navigate the unique challenges of deploying AI systems at scale.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me should you require any further information.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
