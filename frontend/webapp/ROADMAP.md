# Web3 Streaming Platform Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for our blockchain-enabled streaming service. It provides a structured timeline and milestone approach to achieve our goal of delivering a decentralized streaming platform.

## Vision

To create a decentralized streaming platform that empowers creators and viewers through blockchain technology, enabling direct monetization, content ownership, and community governance.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Sprint)

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] Setup development environment with React, TypeScript, and Vite
- [x] Implement ESLint configuration
- [x] Create mock API for local development
- [x] Setup environment variables
- [ ] Create basic layout and navigation structure
- [ ] Implement responsive design system

### Authentication & Identity
- [ ] Implement Web3 wallet connection (MetaMask, WalletConnect)
- [ ] Create wallet authentication flow
- [ ] Design user profile components
- [ ] Setup persistent session management

### Content Discovery
- [ ] Develop homepage with featured streams
- [ ] Create content browsing interface with filters
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Design category and tag system

## Phase 2: Core Features

### Streaming Capabilities
- [ ] Integrate with IPFS for decentralized content storage
- [ ] Implement HLS streaming protocol adapter
- [ ] Create video player with adaptive bitrate
- [ ] Develop stream creation interface
- [ ] Add live streaming capabilities

### Smart Contract Integration
- [ ] Connect to token contract for transactions
- [ ] Implement subscription model using smart contracts
- [ ] Create token-gated content access
- [ ] Design creator monetization dashboard
- [ ] Implement tipping and micro-donations

### Social Features
- [ ] Add commenting system
- [ ] Create follower/subscription management
- [ ] Implement notifications
- [ ] Design social sharing capabilities

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Creator Tools
- [ ] Develop analytics dashboard
- [ ] Create content management system
- [ ] Implement scheduled streams
- [ ] Add multi-participant streaming
- [ ] Create revenue and analytics reporting

### Community & Governance
- [ ] Implement DAO governance structure
- [ ] Create proposal and voting system
- [ ] Design community challenges and rewards
- [ ] Develop content moderation tools

### Advanced Blockchain Features
- [ ] Implement NFT capabilities for content
- [ ] Create token staking for premium features
- [ ] Develop cross-chain compatibility
- [ ] Implement layer 2 solutions for lower gas fees
- [ ] Create content licensing marketplace

## Phase 4: Optimization & Scale

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize client-side rendering
- [ ] Implement edge caching for content
- [ ] Create offline-first capabilities
- [ ] Optimize smart contract interaction patterns
- [ ] Reduce initial load time and bundle size

### User Experience
- [ ] Conduct usability testing
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on feedback
- [ ] Implement accessibility improvements
- [ ] Create onboarding flows for new users
- [ ] Develop mobile apps (React Native)

### Ecosystem
- [ ] Create developer API
- [ ] Build plugin system for extensions
- [ ] Design partner integration program
- [ ] Implement cross-platform authentication

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Frontend Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- State management with React Context API or Redux
- CSS-in-JS with styled-components or emotion
- Component library with design system
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library

### Blockchain Integration
- Web3.js/ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- IPFS for decentralized content storage
- Smart contracts for monetization and access control
- Layer 2 solutions for scalability

### Performance Strategy
- Code splitting for faster initial load
- Service workers for offline capabilities
- Optimistic UI for responsive interactions
- Progressive WebApp (PWA) capabilities
- Lazy loading for media assets

### Security Considerations
- Audit all smart contract integrations
- Implement proper error handling
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Secure key management
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Success Metrics

- Number of active streamers
- Viewer retention and engagement
- Transaction volume
- Platform gas efficiency
- Content diversity and growth
- Community participation
- Developer adoption

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize Phase 1 tasks and establish sprint goals
2. Create detailed tickets for each task
3. Develop a testing strategy for blockchain features
4. Establish design guidelines and component library
5. Begin implementation of authentication and basic UI

This roadmap will be regularly revisited and adjusted based on development progress, user feedback, and changes in the blockchain ecosystem.
